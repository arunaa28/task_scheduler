# Project Profitability Predictor (ML Agent + API)

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts whether a software project will be profitable based on inputs such as team size, complexity, deadline, risk level, and estimated revenue. The ML model is exposed via a Flask REST API and can be consumed by a Java Spring Boot backend or any frontend application.
